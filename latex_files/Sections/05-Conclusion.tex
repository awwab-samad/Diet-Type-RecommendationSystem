\section{Conclusion}
This project presents a focused approach to dietary recommendation for individuals at risk of chronic diseases using a dataset of various medical data. By leveraging the neural network machine learning technique tailored to the available data, our solution aims to provide personalized food choices based on individual health profiles and encourage individuals to make better dietary choices, ultimately contributing to improved long term health and quality of life.

Future research work can proceed in the direction of better optimizing this neural network by adding an additional hidden layer and/or using different number of neurons in each hidden layer. Furthermore, more training data can be used to better train the network and achieve a better accuracy.
